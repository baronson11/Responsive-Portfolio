          <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always been a creator. I've always been someone who
            loves to tinker, modify, create and build things. I've always had this desire to keep learning
            no matter how difficult the topic may be.</p>
          <p>From the first time I ever built a computer, to the first time I installed linux on
          my laptop, to that one time I created an inventory system for my "then" job and was determined
          to build an elaborate backend for it, all the way up until now.</p>
          <p>I believe it is in me to create, to develop, to problem solve and to understand how things work.
            And I love doing all of those things with technology.</p>
